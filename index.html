<h2 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Personal Information:</h2>
<p>My name is Kemal Dogru, and I was born and raised in Australia. I am 18 years old; I was born 10/02/2003. My background is Turkish, and I can speak 2 languages which is Turkish and English. One fact about me is that I have a twin who looks identical to me at first, but eventually you will find out we are not identical, and he goes to Melbourne University.</p>

<h2 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Interest in IT: </h2>
<p>My interest in IT is the fact that you can create something from nothing. You have endless creativity to make your imagination come true. If you want to make your life or job easier, IT can make that happen. My interest in IT started when I did a bit of coding for school using Python. When I saw that IT had limitless potential it got me captivated, plus because of my laziness trait I wanted to use IT to make my life easier and more efficient.</p>

<p>I wanted to get into Bachelor of Software Engineering, however I picked my career too late and did not pick Mathematical Methods. It was too late to change subjects, so I decided to do Bachelor of Information Technology and try my luck in transferring to Bachelor of Software Engineering in 2022.</p>

<p>During my studies I expect to learn countless IT concepts. The main concept I would like to learn is coding, especially Python as it helps me further improve my proficiency of Raspberry Pi, which can help me make electronic artefacts to make my life easier. Other than coding I hope to learn circuitry and the design of electronic artefacts to further improve my understanding of creating them.</p>

<p>The position is a Software Engineer for a company that works on road and traffic management offering smart solutions for tolling, traffic management, road safety, traffic safety and security and smart urban mobility. In the position you help make road traffic safer and more reliable, efficient, and comfortable in urban areas and on highways alike while helping to reduce pollution. This is done by using technology to help make the roads more efficient, by simulations and products they produce. This job appeals to me because of the challenge produced, it has a whole list of qualifications and criteria to fulfil which can be a long-term goal to attain in the distant future. Also, it is a software engineering job which is the degree I want to study.<p>

<p>The skills and qualifications to obtain the job is a numerous amount. You need advanced programming skills in SQL, JavaScript, HTML and Java. These are used in database management, web development and core development, respectively. You also need to be familiar with various communications and application servers. A bachelor’s degree is needed and at least 2 years’ experience as a software engineer. There are many more qualifications and skills but as of now I cannot comprehend or understand what they are.<p>

<p>I currently have basic HTML, Python and SQL experience through first year of a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. I have had only 1 month experience using these languages, which is very minimal. I practically have no experience with IT that is noteworthy, but there is always room to grow and learn, this is just the beginning of the journey.<p>

<p>To obtain these skills during My Bachelor of Software Engineering I would explore the concepts more in depth to get to an advanced level. To prove I reached that level I would aim to get High Distinction in every subject. Also, I would check the qualifications of the job and treat is as a checklist and mark off bit by bit till I achieved them all. Lastly, I would go and get another job as a software engineer to build up the 2 years of experience before I apply for this one.<p>

<h2 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Personal Profile:</h2>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">16 Personalities</h3>

<img src="Person.jpg" alt="Assertive Adventurer">
<p>My personality was ISFP-A which in simple terms is introverted, observant, feeling and prospecting and is typically called Adventurer. I am the assertive type instead of the turbulent type. Assertive Adventurers are more confident and handle stress well. The results improve my self confidence by assuring me that I can handle stress well and am more assertive. As an Assertive Adventurer I believe I work quite well in a team, I sit back observe and calculate which is the best course to take then voice my opinion without being afraid of backlash. This is a good quality to have as good ideas can come out of it. Because I’m the observant type the team I should create should have talkative extroverted individuals so I can observe how well their idea is and follow along.<p>

<br>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Learning Style</h3>


<img src="Personality2.png" alt="Tactile Learner">
<p>Tactile learners are more hands on and learn by doing things. This goes well with my passion for creating electronic artefacts, I can learn key concepts by making mistakes and fixing them. When I apply key concepts my understanding and comprehension is more efficient and effective. The next group project is about making a tangible model of a project idea, because I am a tactile learner, I can learn how to produce the final product by making many failed prototypes and trial and error, thus contributing my share to the group. When forming a group, I can look for other auditory and visual learners so we can be balanced group that is competent in learning and applying key concepts together. Furthermore, we can help each other learn and grow about IT.<p>

<br>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Big Five Personality</h3>


<img src="Personality3.png" alt="Intelligent/Imaginative">
<p>The highest factor was Intellect/Imagination, while Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Emotional Stability were relatively all also high in a similar level. The lowest factor was Extroversion, which is the act of being extroverted and outgoing. As I have high imagination while working on the project idea with a group, I can have good ideas to work around any limitations to achieve our product. When conscientiousness is high it means you are careful and diligent instead of impulsive and disorganised. With this I always come prepared and will have the assignment done by the due date making me reliable in a group setting. My agreeableness is high so I would not cause many conflicts with group mates and go along with the flow, having a good work environment. As my emotion stability is high, I would not ruin the mood with any negative emotions on display. The only limitation is I would not be as talkative and only would talk if I have something important to contribute as my extroversion level was quite low.<p>

<h2 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Project Idea:</h2>
<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Oveview:</h3>
<p>The project that I am going for is an AI hub that can control your room. It is an electronic artefact that is voice activated to control the various electronic devices within your room. For example, lights are voice activated so you do not need to leave your bed when sleeping, or you can also use it to turn on your aircon and even other numerous electronics within your room. When you speak to this hub it sends a signal to the electronic device, you are referring to activating it and thus removes the need to actively turn on the device.<p>

<br>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Motivation</h3>
<p>This project is highly interesting and invigorating to me because I am undeniably lazy and would like to make my life easier any chance there is. By making my room voice activated without the nee to exert energy for minor inconveniences highly appeals to me. On another note, I have knee problems so to remove the need to walk around your room for minor tasks will help me from overexerting my legs. However, because of my laziness my motivation for creating this electronic artefact may be affected, which is why I hope my motivation may extend past my laziness trait.<p>

<br>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Description</h3>
<p>The main feature of this electronic artefact would be it voice recognition technology to activate the numerous devices and other technologies around your room. This electronic artefact would be the hub of all activation for the devices within your room. This electronic artefact can be made at a relatively low cost which the only purchases made would be Raspberry Pi technology. This electronic artefact will also have many features, one of them being a programmable hub. The Raspberry Pi technology can be updated and configured to fix bugs or to simply add any new devices for the hub to communicate with. Another optional feature which can be included is to have a speaker and for the hub to respond to your sentences. For example, if you activate a device it could say “right on it, Sir Clapp”, this gives a sense of realism to the hub making it seem sentient. For security measures a GPS can be put on the hub just in case it is lost or stolen, however as it is low cost it is more efficient to just buy Raspberry Pi technology and make it again. If needed this hub can be put in other rooms such as the living room and activate other devices, it is not just confined to your room. You can also program your own features into the hub, such as reacting and responding a certain way to your sentences, to make it more entertaining. It is not just to automate your room; it can also be used to make a personal robot to talk too. However, some limitations of this device are the lack of knowledge and expertise. This device can only be created by someone who is knowledgeable about programming and Raspberry Pi technology and have a certain level of expertise. Without any experience the hub would be hard to create and customise. The hub is generally used to make your room a smart room, without the need to waste energy in menial tasks. Another limitation can be the size of the hub as it is Raspberry Pi technology it is rather small and easy to lose. Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi technology is not very appealing to look at, as it is not slick as the Alexa, but it is cheaper. Also, as it is self-programmable many bugs can occur as a fault of human error or it could be just hardware error.<p>

<br>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>This electronic artefact would be controlled by Raspberry Pi technology. The hubs main component to make this work is an “ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array for Raspberry Pi” combined with voice recognition software that outputs an action depending on what you say, which is the input. With this another component called the “Transmitter” would send signals out around your room, and the devices you want activated would have an “Receiver” to interpret and use the signals to activate the device. The Raspberry Pi would be coded with Python because of my limited knowledge on other coding languages, as it is easy to read and understand for someone with my expertise.<p>

<br>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Skills Required</h3>
<p>The skills required to make the hub is not very difficult to achieve. You just need to know Python which is the easiest language to learn and understand and learn Raspberry Pi technology which is user friendly. The hardware used is the Raspberry Pi circuitry and components and the software used is the Raspberry Pi OS to code in python. Raspberry Pi technology is meant for beginner users who have an interest in making electronic artefacts. The feasibility to find the skills to create the hub is high, as the skills needed is basic and not as advanced. However, many bugs may persist, and the hub may not be efficient or effective.<p>

<br>

<h3 style="border:2px solid#000000;background-color:#FFBD3B">Outcome</h3>
<p>If this project is successful you would have a fully operating smart room.  The You now do not need to get out of the chair or bed when resting for menial tasks, just need to speak to solve all your problems. Also, problems with lack of expertise or knowledge can be solved with research or getting help from someone qualified, as once the hub is completed and operational for 30 or so years, which is the same as modern electronics. The minimum lifespan would be 10 years which the connectors would fail from oxidation. Furthermore, losing the Raspberry Pi is not a problem as it’s cheap to make, the only real problem is the unappealing look. The only possible solution is to put it in a nice-looking case with a hole so it can hear you, even then it is not guaranteed to work. Ultimately creating an electronic artefact which is called the hub to activate your devices with the sound of your voice further amplifies your laziness. As once said by Mark Kennedy “All of the biggest technological inventions created by man - the airplane, the automobile, the computer - says little about his intelligence, but speaks volumes about his laziness.”<p>
